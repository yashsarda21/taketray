# Learning guide: Phase 6, background detection and notifications

This guide explains how TakeTray notices new clips while it is closed, and how it reminds you without nagging: the new-clips notification, the evening reminder, the 14-day "Still shooting?" question, and what happens after a restart. It also covers the help screen for phones that stop apps in the background.

Every snippet is real code from this repository. You don't need to know Flutter or Android well to follow it; basic programming knowledge is enough.

## How to read this guide

- **The big picture first.** Until Phase 5, TakeTray only looked for new videos while it was open. Phase 6 adds a small piece of Android code that runs **without** the Flutter part of the app:
  - Dart keeps a **copy** of what that code needs (Shooting mode on or off, where each volume's scan stopped, the watched folders, the reminder settings) in Android's own storage;
  - an Android **job** wakes up when the phone's video library changes, counts the new videos and updates one quiet notification;
  - **alarms** fire the reminders;
  - the database stays Dart's alone: the only thing that flows back from Android is a button tapped in the notification shade.
- **Order.** The sections follow the order the phase was built, from Section 2 on. Step 1 was the plan and decision D-101 (what Phase 6 builds now and what waits), so it has no section here.
  - the design-system pieces (2);
  - the bridge between Dart and Android (3);
  - the new-clips job (4) and the reminders (5), in Kotlin;
  - Dart keeping the copy in step (6);
  - the screens: taps, the dialog, the permission and the help screen (7);
  - two media repairs parked from Phase 3 (8);
  - the proof on the phone (9).
- **Names you will meet.** `D-xx` is an entry in `docs/decisions.md`; this phase's start at D-101. "Spec §8.3" is a section of `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-24-taketray-v1-build-design.md`.
- **Commands.** Run them from the repository root, through the wrappers in `tool/` (`tool/flutter`, `tool/check`, `tool/test_android`). Run a single Dart test file from `app/` (`cd app && ../tool/flutter test test/...`).
- **Every section has the same shape:** **what we built**, **why TakeTray needs it**, **key ideas** (with short snippets of real code), **where it lives**, **try it yourself** and **decisions**.
